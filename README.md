# lab2_secure_web
## Purpose
For this project I will be creating a website that uses MySQL as the database, PHP for the backend to allow the user to store and retrieve information to, and HTML which is the front end that will display the information that the back end has sent for the user to read 

To be able to run this website you will also need to have a localhost installed in your computer in which I used AMMPS since it comes with PHP and MYSQl, another alternative can be XAMMPS.

## Set up

To be able to run this website you will need to set up your database in MySQL to be able to contain two tables which these tables will be the User and Admin tables. Within these tables you want to have 
1. first name
2. last name
3. username
4. password
